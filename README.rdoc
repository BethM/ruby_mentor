These exercises are coding exercises that I have my mentoring students
run through when I see them struggling with a particular concept, or
if I think they need more practice on a given topic.

I've found it's helpful to have them approach learning a given concept
from several different angles.

Some of these exercises are Ruby, some are Ruby on Rails. If you are
doing a given exercise, don't use Rails unless you really need to.
